    "- Fixed Size\n",
    "- Insertion and Deletion are expensive operations\n",
    "- Needs COntiguous Memory, but memory might have sufficient contiguous memory\n",
    "- Friendly for Random Access\n",
    "- But Arrays are cache (Temporal and Spacial) friendly:\n",
    "     - Spatial Locality Reference: also termed data locality) refers to the use of data elements within relatively close storage locations.\n",
    "     - Temporal Locality Reference: reuse of specific data and/or resources within a relatively small time duration\n",

    "### LinkedList:\n",
    "- Dynamic Data Structure\n",
    "- Can be deleted or expanded at run time\n",
    "- Sequentially Acessed; unfriendly for process that involve random access\n",
    "- Cache unfriendly due to the fact that it might necessarily use contiguous memory\n",
    "- Takes more memory spaces than arrays because for every value a node address that points to the next node is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Applications of Linkedlists\n",
    "- Linked lists are preferable over arrays when:\n",
    "    - you need constant-time insertions/deletions from the list (such as in real-time computing where time predictability is absolutely critical)\n",
    "    - you don't know how many items will be in the list. With arrays, you may need to re-declare and copy memory if the array grows too big\n",
    "    - you don't need random access to any elements\n",
    "    - you want to be able to insert items in the middle of the list (such as a priority queue)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Arrays are preferable when:\n",
    "    - you need indexed/random access to elements\n",
    "    - you know the number of elements in the array ahead of time so that you can allocate the correct amount of memory for the array\n",
    "    - you need speed when iterating through all the elements in sequence. You can use pointer math on the array to access each element, whereas you need to lookup the node based on the pointer for each element in linked list, which may result in page faults which may result in performance hits.\n",
    "    - memory is a concern. Filled arrays take up less memory than linked lists. Each element in the array is just the data. Each linked list node requires the data as well as one (or more) pointers to the other elements in the linked list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Using linked lists for priority queues is a very stupid idea. Dynamic array-backed heaps allow for O(lg n) amortized insertion and worst-case logarithmic delete-min, and are among the fastest practical priority queue structures."
